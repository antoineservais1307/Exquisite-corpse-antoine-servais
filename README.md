# the story of a superhero with the power of flying but only asleep

 



In the quiet suburb of Elmwood, young Max discovered an extraordinary secret. By day, he was an ordinary teenager, but each night, as he drifted into sleep, he gained the power of flight.

Soaring through the moonlit skies, Max used his unique gift to help those in need. Yet, as dawn approached, he would always return to his bed, his heroic deeds known only to the stars.
