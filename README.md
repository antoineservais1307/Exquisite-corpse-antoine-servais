# the story of a superhero with the power of flying but only asleep


Somna, the Sleep-Flyer, has the unique ability to fly only while he is asleep, entering a state of semi-consciousness that allows him to navigate the skies instinctively.

His power is enhanced by his mastery of lucid dreaming, enabling him to control his actions and surroundings with precision during his flights.

While asleep, his reflexes are heightened, making him incredibly agile and responsive to any threats or obstacles he encounters.


 



In the quiet suburb of Elmwood, young Max discovered an extraordinary secret. By day, he was an ordinary teenager, but each night, as he drifted into sleep, he gained the power of flight.

Soaring through the moonlit skies, Max used his unique gift to help those in need. Yet, as dawn approached, he would always return to his bed, his heroic deeds known only to the stars.
